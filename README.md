Here are some common issues or gaps that can be identified in each section based on the content visible in the image:


---

1. Business Requirement and Model Output & Usage

Misalignment with business goals – Model outputs may not meet decision-making requirements.

Lack of documentation – Missing details about assumptions and limitations.

Incomplete validation – Insufficient verification of policies and tiering rules.

Vendor dependency risks – Poor assessment of internal vs external solutions.



---

2. Model Development Data

Data quality issues – Errors in data sources, types, and formats.

Insufficient preprocessing – Gaps in cleaning, transformation, and handling of missing values.

Data reconciliation errors – Failure to ensure integrity and consistency across datasets.

Inadequate replication – Poor validation of preprocessing steps or transformations.



---

3. Model Methodology and Model Selection

Unclear rationale for model selection – Justification for techniques or algorithms may be missing.

Limited performance evaluation – Incomplete testing, metrics, or trade-off analysis.

Algorithm bias risks – Improper handling of bias in AI/ML models.

Vendor dependency gaps – Lack of required documentation in vendor-provided solutions.

4. Model Specifications

Incomplete documentation – Missing details about formulas, assumptions, or parameter settings.

Inconsistent transformations – Errors in variable transformations or coding logic.

Lack of validation – Failure to validate input-output mapping and mathematical logic.

Code implementation errors – Issues with implementation or incomplete code snippets.



---

5. Model Testing and Evaluation

Incorrect metric thresholds – Misalignment between performance metrics and business goals.

Overfitting or underfitting – Model performs well on training but poorly on unseen data.

Unexplored metrics – Limited evaluation metrics, such as ignoring precision-recall trade-offs.

Unclear success criteria – Ambiguous benchmarks for RAG scoring and validation results.

Incomplete test cases – Missing scenarios for edge cases or stress testing.



---

6. Model Monitoring Framework

Infrequent monitoring – Lack of regular performance checks leading to degradation.

Metric drift issues – Ignoring changes in PSI, Gini index, or detection rates over time.

Lack of retraining strategy – No predefined steps for retraining models with new data.

Documentation gaps – Missing logs for monitoring activities and results.

Failure to identify bias or drift – Overlooking data or concept drift impacting predictions.
