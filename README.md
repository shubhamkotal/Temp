Title: Human-Calibrated Automated Testing and Validation of Generative Language Models

Purpose:

The paper introduces a method called Human-Calibrated Automated Testing (HCAT) for evaluating generative language models (GLMs), especially those used in high-stakes fields like banking. The aim is to make sure these models are accurate, safe, and meet industry standards.


---

Step-by-Step Overview

1. Challenges in Evaluating GLMs

Open-ended Outputs: GLMs produce various possible responses, so there’s no single "correct" answer, making evaluation hard.

Complexity of RAG Systems: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine document retrieval (finding information) with generation (creating answers), which makes them harder to test.

High-Stakes Domains: Industries like banking need these models to be transparent, reliable, and compliant with regulations because mistakes can have serious consequences.



---

2. Proposed Framework

The paper introduces HCAT to evaluate GLMs using automated tests and human feedback. It focuses on:

Functionality: What the model can do well.

Risks and Safety: Avoiding harmful or biased outputs.

Scalability: Making the evaluation process easy to repeat on a large scale.

Key Components of HCAT

1. Automatic Test Generation

Generate a wide variety of test cases using structured methods.

Use topic modeling (grouping similar documents) to cover all areas of knowledge the model might deal with.

Automate the creation of diverse queries, including simple, complex, and adversarial (tricky) questions.



---

2. Functionality Metrics

The framework measures how well the model performs key tasks:

Context Relevance:

Checks if the documents retrieved by the model match the user’s question.

For example, if a user asks about loan options, the retrieved information should be related to loans, not unrelated topics.


Groundedness:

Ensures that generated answers are based on retrieved documents.

Prevents the model from making up ("hallucinating") facts or information that isn’t in the documents.


Completeness:

Ensures that the generated answer includes all important information from the documents.

For example, if the context mentions three benefits of a loan, the answer should include all three, not just one or two.


Answer Relevance:

Measures whether the generated response directly answers the user’s query.

Avoids irrelevant or off-topic answers.




---

3. Risk and Safety Metrics

These metrics ensure the model behaves responsibly:

Toxicity:

Evaluates if the model generates harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content.

Important for maintaining professionalism, especially in customer-facing industries.


Bias:

Tests whether the model treats all users fairly, regardless of their background (e.g., gender, race, or income level).

Avoids discriminatory or unfair responses.


Privacy:

Ensures that the model does not reveal sensitive or private information, such as a customer’s account details.

Uses techniques like detecting and filtering sensitive terms.




---

4. Calibration with Human Judgments

Combines machine-generated scores with human evaluations to improve accuracy.

Step 1: Human feedback is used to adjust automated metrics so they align with what humans consider a good answer.

Step 2: Adds a second layer of validation using techniques like confidence scores to show how certain the model is about its evaluation.



---

5. Robustness Testing

Tests how well the model performs in challenging scenarios:

Adversarial Inputs: Inputs designed to confuse the model (e.g., contradictory or tricky questions).

Out-of-Distribution Queries: Questions the model hasn’t seen before to test how it handles unfamiliar topics.

Input Variations: Checks if the model can handle typos, slang, or unstructured language from users.




---

6. Weakness Identification

Identifies specific areas where the model struggles:

Marginal Analysis: Breaks down performance by topic or question type to find weak spots.

Bivariate Analysis: Looks at how two factors (e.g., topic and complexity) interact to uncover deeper weaknesses.


Visualization tools like heatmaps help highlight areas for improvement.



---

Benefits of the Framework

Comprehensive Testing: Covers all possible types of inputs and topics.

Explainable Metrics: Uses clear and interpretable methods to evaluate performance.

Trustworthy Evaluations: Aligns automated evaluations with human expectations.

Robustness: Ensures consistent performance in real-world scenarios, even under challenging conditions.

Focused Improvements: Pinpoints weaknesses for targeted fixes, making the model better over time.

Conclusion

The HCAT framework provides a detailed, scalable, and transparent way to test GLMs, especially RAG systems, in critical industries like banking. It ensures these models are reliable, safe, and meet strict industry requirements while also being adaptable for future advancements in technology.

Section 2: Automatic Test Generation

How to create diverse queries for thorough testing:

1. Embedding: Text is converted into numerical vectors (embeddings) to represent meanings. Tools like BERT and SimCSE are used.


2. Dimensionality Reduction: High-dimensional embeddings are reduced using techniques like PCA and UMAP, making them easier to analyze.


3. Clustering: Similar documents are grouped into topics using algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN.


4. Stratified Sampling: Queries are selected evenly across topics to ensure balanced testing.


5. LLM-Driven Query Generation: Large Language Models (LLMs) create queries of varying complexity (e.g., factual, reasoning-based).

Section 3: Functionality Metrics

Metrics to measure how well the model performs tasks:

1. Context Relevancy:

Checks if retrieved documents match the query.

Measured by comparing query sentences with document sentences using cosine similarity.



2. Groundedness:

Ensures the generated answer relies on provided documents.

Measured by:

Sentence similarity (e.g., how closely answer sentences match the documents).

Natural Language Inference (NLI) to detect logical consistency.




3. Completeness:

Measures if the answer covers all relevant document points.

Uses:

Sentence similarity (assessing coverage of document sentences).

Wasserstein Distance (assessing overall alignment between document and answer content).




4. Answer Relevancy:

Checks if the answer directly addresses the query.

Uses sentence similarity between the query and the answer.

Section 4: Risk and Safety Metrics

Ensuring the model is safe and responsible:

1. Toxicity: Assesses harmful or offensive content using tools like detoxification models.


2. Bias Evaluation: Tests responses for fairness across different demographics.
