To improve precision in your logistic regression model when dealing with imbalanced data, two effective techniques are SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and adjusting class weights. Research has shown that these methods can significantly enhance model performance, including precision and the ability to use higher cutoffs.

1. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**:
   - SMOTE works by generating synthetic samples for the minority class, thus balancing the class distribution. This method has been shown to improve the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and precision by creating a more balanced dataset for training.
   - A study published in the *Journal of Big Data* highlighted that using SMOTE for oversampling the minority class in combination with logistic regression can lead to better model calibration and discrimination, which translates into higher precision and recall metrics. This approach can help the model make better predictions with higher cutoffs【18†source】.

2. **Class Weight Adjustment**:
   - Adjusting class weights involves assigning a higher weight to the minority class during model training. This technique helps the logistic regression model pay more attention to the minority class, thus improving the precision of predictions.
   - According to an article on Analytics India Magazine, class weight adjustment helps balance the model's bias towards the majority class, leading to improved model reliability and prediction accuracy. The balanced class weights ensure that the minority class is adequately represented, which enhances precision and allows the model to use higher decision thresholds effectively【17†source】.

Both these methods have been validated in multiple studies and are implemented in standard machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn. They offer practical solutions to improve model performance in imbalanced datasets, thereby addressing the issue of low precision and enabling higher cutoffs in logistic regression models.
